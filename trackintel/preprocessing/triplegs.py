    """
    Reduce number of points while retaining structure of tripleg.

    A wrapper function using shapely.simplify():
    https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html#object.simplify

    Parameters
    ----------
    triplegs: GeoDataFrame (as trackintel triplegs)
        triplegs to be simplified

    tolerance: float, default 1.0
        a higher tolerance removes more points; the units of tolerance are the same as the
        projection of the input geometry

    preserve_topology: bool, default True
        whether to preserve topology. If set to False the Douglas-Peucker algorithm is used.

    Returns
    -------
    ret_tpls: GeoDataFrame (as trackintel triplegs)

    Parameters
    ----------
    staypoints : GeoDataFrame (as trackintel staypoints)

    triplegs : GeoDataFrame (as trackintel triplegs)

    gap_threshold : float, default 15 (minutes)
        Maximum allowed temporal gap size in minutes. If tracking data is missing for more than
        `gap_threshold` minutes, then a new trip begins after the gap.

    add_geometry : bool default True
        If True, the start and end coordinates of each trip are added to the output table in a geometry column "geom"
        of type MultiPoint. Set `add_geometry=False` for better runtime performance (if coordinates are not required).

    print_progress : bool, default False
        If print_progress is True, the progress bar is displayed

    Returns
    -------
    sp: GeoDataFrame (as trackintel staypoints)
        The original staypoints with new columns ``[`trip_id`, `prev_trip_id`, `next_trip_id`]``.

    tpls: GeoDataFrame (as trackintel triplegs)
        The original triplegs with a new column ``[`trip_id`]``.

    trips: (Geo)DataFrame (as trackintel trips)
        The generated trips.

    Notes
    -----
    Trips are an aggregation level in transport planning that summarize all movement and all non-essential actions
    (e.g., waiting) between two relevant activities.
    The function returns altered versions of the input staypoints and triplegs. Staypoints receive the fields
    [`trip_id` `prev_trip_id` and `next_trip_id`], triplegs receive the field [`trip_id`].
    The following assumptions are implemented

        - If we do not record a person for more than `gap_threshold` minutes,
          we assume that the person performed an activity in the recording gap and split the trip at the gap.
        - Trips that start/end in a recording gap can have an unknown origin/destination
        - There are no trips without a (recorded) tripleg
        - Trips optionally have their start and end point as geometry of type MultiPoint, if `add_geometry==True`
        - If the origin (or destination) staypoint is unknown, and `add_geometry==True`, the origin (and destination)
          geometry is set as the first coordinate of the first tripleg (or the last coordinate of the last tripleg),
          respectively. Trips with missing values can still be identified via col `origin_staypoint_id`.


    Examples
    --------
    >>> from trackintel.preprocessing.triplegs import generate_trips
    >>> staypoints, triplegs, trips = generate_trips(staypoints, triplegs)

    trips can also be directly generated using the tripleg accessor
    >>> staypoints, triplegs, trips = triplegs.as_triplegs.generate_trips(staypoints)
