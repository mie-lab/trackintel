    Generate locations from the staypoints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    staypoints : GeoDataFrame (as trackintel staypoints)
        The staypoints have to follow the standard definition for staypoints DataFrames.

    method : {'dbscan'}
        Method to create locations.

        - 'dbscan' : Uses the DBSCAN algorithm to cluster staypoints.

    epsilon : float, default 100
        The epsilon for the 'dbscan' method. if 'distance_metric' is 'haversine'
        or 'euclidean', the unit is in meters.

    num_samples : int, default 1
        The minimal number of samples in a cluster.

    distance_metric: {'haversine', 'euclidean'}
        The distance metric used by the applied method. Any mentioned below are possible:
        https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances.html

    agg_level: {'user','dataset'}
        The level of aggregation when generating locations:
        - 'user'      : locations are generated independently per-user.
        - 'dataset'   : shared locations are generated for all users.

    print_progress : bool, default False
        If print_progress is True, the progress bar is displayed

    n_jobs: int, default 1
        The maximum number of concurrently running jobs. If -1 all CPUs are used. If 1 is given, no parallel
        computing code is used at all, which is useful for debugging. See
        https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parallel.html#parallel-reference-documentation

    """
    Aggregate staypoints horizontally via time threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    staypoints : GeoDataFrame (as trackintel staypoints)
        The staypoints must contain a column `location_id` (see `generate_locations` function) and have to follow the
        standard trackintel definition for staypoints DataFrames.

    triplegs: GeoDataFrame (as trackintel triplegs)
        The triplegs have to follow the standard definition for triplegs DataFrames.

    max_time_gap : str or pd.Timedelta, default "10min"
        Maximum duration between staypoints to still be merged.
        If str must be parsable by pd.to_timedelta.

    agg: dict, optional
        Dictionary to aggregate the rows after merging staypoints. This dictionary is used as input to the pandas
        aggregate function: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.agg.html
        If empty, only the required columns of staypoints (which are ['user_id', 'started_at', 'finished_at']) are
        aggregated and returned. In order to return for example also the geometry column of the merged staypoints, set
        'agg={"geom":"first"}' to return the first geometry of the merged staypoints, or 'agg={"geom":"last"}' to use
        the last one.

    Returns
    -------
    sp: DataFrame
        The new staypoints with the default columns and columns in `agg`, where staypoints at same location and close in
        time are aggregated.

    Notes
    -----
    - Due to the modification of the staypoint index, the relation between the staypoints and the corresponding
      positionfixes **is broken** after execution of this function! In explanation, the staypoint_id column of pfs does
      not necessarily correspond to an id in the new sp table that is returned from this function. The same holds for
      trips (if generated yet) where the staypoints contained in a trip might be merged in this function.
    - If there is a tripleg between two staypoints, the staypoints are not merged. If you for some reason want to merge
      such staypoints, simply pass an empty DataFrame for the tpls argument.

    Examples
    --------
