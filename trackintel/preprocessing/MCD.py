class MCD(MinCovDet):
    """
    Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD): robust estimator of covariance.

    The Minimum Covariance Determinant covariance estimator is to be applied
    on Gaussian-distributed data, but could still be relevant on data
    drawn from a unimodal, symmetric distribution. It is not meant to be used
    with multi-modal data (the algorithm used to fit a MinCovDet object is
    likely to fail in such a case).
    One should consider projection pursuit methods to deal with multi-modal
    datasets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    contamination : float in (0., 0.5], default=0.1
        The proportion of contamination in the dataset.
    store_precision : bool, default=True
        Specify if the estimated precision is stored.
    assume_centered : bool, default=False
        If True, the support of the robust location and the covariance
        estimates is computed, and a covariance estimate is recomputed from
        it, without centering the data.
        Useful to work with data whose mean is significantly equal to
        zero but is not exactly zero.
        If False, the robust location and covariance are directly computed
        with the FastMCD algorithm without additional treatment.
    support_fraction : float (0., 1.), optional
        The proportion of points to be included in the support of the raw
        MCD estimate. Default is None, which implies that the minimum
        value of support_fraction will be used within the algorithm:
        [n_sample + n_features + 1] / 2
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.
