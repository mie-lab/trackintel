    Parameters
    ----------
    trips : GeoDataFrame (as trackintel trips)
        The trips have to follow the standard definition for trips DataFrames

    staypoints : GeoDataFrame (as trackintel staypoints, preprocessed to contain location IDs), default None
        The staypoints have to follow the standard definition for staypoints DataFrames. The location ID column
        is necessary to connect trips via locations to a tour. If None, trips will be connected based only on a
        distance threshold `max_dist`.

    max_dist: float, default 100 (meters)
        Maximum distance between the end point of one trip and the start point of the next trip on a tour.
        This is parameter is only used if staypoints is None!
        Also, if `max_nr_gaps > 0`, a tour can contain larger spatial gaps (see Notes below)

    max_time: str or pd.Timedelta, default "1d" (1 day)
        Maximum time that a tour is allowed to take

    max_nr_gaps: int, default 0
        Maximum number of spatial gaps on the tour. Use with caution - see notes below.

    print_progress : bool, default False
        If print_progress is True, the progress bar is displayed


    Returns
    -------
    trips_with_tours: GeoDataFrame (as trackintel trips)
        Same as `trips`, but with column `tour_id`, containing a list of the tours that the trip is part of (see notes).

    tours: GeoDataFrame (as trackintel tours)
        The generated tours

    Examples
    --------
    >>> trips.as_trips.generate_tours(staypoints)

    Notes
    -------
    - Tours are defined as a collection of trips in a certain time frame that start and end at the same point
    - Tours and trips have an N:N relationship: One tour consists of multiple trips, but also one trip can be part of
      multiple tours, due to nested tours or overlapping tours.
    - This function implements two possibilities to generate tours of trips: Via the location ID in the `staypoints`
      df, or via a maximum distance. Thus, note that only one of the parameters `staypoints` or `max_dist` is used!
    - Nested tours are possible and will be regarded as 2 (or more tours).
    - It is possible to allow spatial gaps to occur on the tour, which might be useful to deal with missing data.
      Example: The two trips home-work, supermarket-home would still be detected as a tour when max_nr_gaps >= 1,
      although the work-supermarket trip is missing.
      Warning: This only counts the number of gaps, but neither temporal or spatial distance of gaps, nor the number
      of missing trips in a gap are bounded. Thus, this parameter should be set with caution, because trips that are
      hours apart might still be connected to a tour if `max_nr_gaps > 0`.
