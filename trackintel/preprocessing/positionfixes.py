    Generate staypoints from positionfixes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    positionfixes : GeoDataFrame (as trackintel positionfixes)
        The positionfixes have to follow the standard definition for positionfixes DataFrames.

    method : {'sliding'}
        Method to create staypoints. 'sliding' applies a sliding window over the data.

    distance_metric : {'haversine'}
        The distance metric used by the applied method.

    dist_threshold : float, default 100
        The distance threshold for the 'sliding' method, i.e., how far someone has to travel to
        generate a new staypoint. Units depend on the dist_func parameter. If 'distance_metric' is 'haversine' the
        unit is in meters

    time_threshold : float, default 5.0 (minutes)
        The time threshold for the 'sliding' method in minutes.

    gap_threshold : float, default 15.0 (minutes)
        The time threshold of determine whether a gap exists between consecutive pfs. Consecutive pfs with
        temporal gaps larger than 'gap_threshold' will be excluded from staypoints generation.
        Only valid in 'sliding' method.

    include_last: boolean, default False
        The algorithm in Li et al. (2008) only detects staypoint if the user steps out
        of that staypoint. This will omit the last staypoint (if any). Set 'include_last'
        to True to include this last staypoint.

    print_progress: boolean, default False
        Show per-user progress if set to True.

    exclude_duplicate_pfs: boolean, default True
        Filters duplicate positionfixes before generating staypoints. Duplicates can lead to problems in later
        processing steps (e.g., when generating triplegs). It is not recommended to set this to False.

    n_jobs: int, default 1
        The maximum number of concurrently running jobs. If -1 all CPUs are used. If 1 is given, no parallel
        computing code is used at all, which is useful for debugging. See
        https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parallel.html#parallel-reference-documentation
        for a detailed description

    Returns
    -------
    pfs: GeoDataFrame (as trackintel positionfixes)
        The original positionfixes with a new column ``[`staypoint_id`]``.

    sp: GeoDataFrame (as trackintel staypoints)
        The generated staypoints.

    Notes
    -----
    The 'sliding' method is adapted from Li et al. (2008). In the original algorithm, the 'finished_at'
    time for the current staypoint lasts until the 'tracked_at' time of the first positionfix outside
    this staypoint. Users are assumed to be stationary during this missing period and potential tracking
    gaps may be included in staypoints. To avoid including too large missing signal gaps, set 'gap_threshold'
    to a small value, e.g., 15 min.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> pfs.as_positionfixes.generate_staypoints('sliding', dist_threshold=100)

    """Generate triplegs from positionfixes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    positionfixes : GeoDataFrame (as trackintel positionfixes)
        The positionfixes have to follow the standard definition for positionfixes DataFrames.
        If 'staypoint_id' column is not found, 'staypoints' needs to be given.

    staypoints : GeoDataFrame (as trackintel staypoints), optional
        The staypoints (corresponding to the positionfixes). If this is not passed, the
        positionfixes need 'staypoint_id' associated with them.

    method: {'between_staypoints'}
        Method to create triplegs. 'between_staypoints' method defines a tripleg as all positionfixes
        between two staypoints (no overlap). This method requires either a column 'staypoint_id' on
        the positionfixes or passing staypoints as an input.

    gap_threshold: float, default 15 (minutes)
        Maximum allowed temporal gap size in minutes. If tracking data is missing for more than
        `gap_threshold` minutes, a new tripleg will be generated.

    Returns
    -------
    pfs: GeoDataFrame (as trackintel positionfixes)
        The original positionfixes with a new column ``[`tripleg_id`]``.

    tpls: GeoDataFrame (as trackintel triplegs)
        The generated triplegs.

    Notes
    -----
    Methods 'between_staypoints' requires either a column 'staypoint_id' on the
    positionfixes or passing some staypoints that correspond to the positionfixes!
    This means you usually should call ``generate_staypoints()`` first.

    The first positionfix after a staypoint is regarded as the first positionfix of the
    generated tripleg. The generated tripleg will not have overlapping positionfix with
    the existing staypoints. This means a small temporal gap in user's trace will occur
    between the first positionfix of staypoint and the last positionfix of tripleg:
    pfs_stp_first['tracked_at'] - pfs_tpl_last['tracked_at'].
