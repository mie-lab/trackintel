    """Extract staypoints from positionfixes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    positionfixes : GeoDataFrame
        The positionfixes have to follow the standard definition for positionfixes DataFrames.

    method : {'sliding' or 'dbscan'}
        The following methods are available to extract staypoints from positionfixes:

        'sliding' : Applies a sliding window over the data.
        'dbscan' : Uses the DBSCAN algorithm to find clusters of staypoints.

    dist_threshold : float
        The distance threshold for the 'sliding' method, i.e., how far someone has to travel to
        generate a new staypoint.

    time_threshold : float
        The time threshold for the 'sliding' method in seconds, i.e., how long someone has to 
        stay within an area to consider it as a staypoint.

    epsilon : float
        The epsilon for the 'dbscan' method.

    dist_func : function
        A function that expects (lon_1, lat_1, lon_2, lat_2) and computes a distance in meters.

    Returns
    -------
    GeoDataFrame
        A new GeoDataFrame containing points where a person spent some time.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> extract_staypoints(...)
