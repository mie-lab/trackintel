def location_identifier(staypoints, method="FREQ", pre_filter=True, **pre_filter_kwargs):
    """Assign "home" and "work" activity label for each user with different methods.

    Parameters
    ----------
    staypoints : Geodataframe (as trackintel staypoints)
        Staypoints with column "location_id".

    method : {'FREQ', 'OSNA'}, default "FREQ"
        'FREQ': Generate an activity label per user by assigning the most visited location the label "home"
        and the second most visited location the label "work". The remaining locations get no label.
        'OSNA': Use weekdays data divided in three time frames ["rest", "work", "leisure"]. Finds most popular
        home location for timeframes "rest" and "leisure" and most popular "work" location for "work" timeframe.

    pre_filter : bool, default True
        Prefiltering the staypoints to exclude locations with not enough data.
        The filter function can also be accessed via `pre_filter_locations`.

    pre_filter_kwargs : dict
        Kwargs to hand to `pre_filter_locations` if used. See function for more informations.

    Returns
    -------
    sp: Geodataframe (as trackintel staypoints)
        With additional column `purpose` assigning one of three activity labels {'home', 'work', None}.

    Note
    ----
    The methods are adapted from [1]. The original algorithms count the distinct hours at a
    location as the home location is derived from geo-tagged tweets. We directly sum the time
    spent at a location as our data model includes that.
