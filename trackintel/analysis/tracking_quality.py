def temporal_tracking_quality(source, granularity="all"):
    """
    Calculate per-user temporal tracking quality (temporal coverage).

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : GeoDataFrame (as trackintel datamodels)
        The source dataframe to calculate temporal tracking quality.

    granularity : {"all", "day", "week", "weekday", "hour"}
        The level of which the tracking quality is calculated. The default "all" returns
        the overall tracking quality; "day" the tracking quality by days; "week" the quality
        by weeks; "weekday" the quality by day of the week (e.g, Mondays, Tuesdays, etc.) and
        "hour" the quality by hours.

    Returns
    -------
    quality: DataFrame
        A per-user per-granularity temporal tracking quality dataframe.

    Notes
    -----
    Requires at least the following columns:
    ``['user_id', 'started_at', 'finished_at']``
    which means the function supports trackintel ``staypoints``, ``triplegs``, ``trips`` and ``tours``
    datamodels and their combinations (e.g., staypoints and triplegs sequence).

    The temporal tracking quality is the ratio of tracking time and the total time extent. It is
    calculated and returned per-user in the defined ``granularity``. The possible time extents of
    the different granularities are different:

    - ``all`` considers the time between the latest "finished_at" and the earliest "started_at";
    - ``week`` considers the whole week (604800 sec)
    - ``day`` and ``weekday`` consider the whole day (86400 sec)
    - ``hour`` considers the whole hour (3600 sec).

    The tracking quality of each user is calculated based on his or her own tracking extent.
    For granularity = ``day`` or ``week``, the quality["day"] or quality["week"] column displays the
    time relative to the first record in the entire dataset.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # calculate overall tracking quality of stps
    >>> temporal_tracking_quality(stps, granularity="all")
    >>> # calculate per-day tracking quality of stps and tpls sequence
    >>> temporal_tracking_quality(stps_tpls, granularity="day")
