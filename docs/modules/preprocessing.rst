Preprocessing
*************

The preprocessing module contains a variety of functions to transform mobility and tracking 
data into richer data sources.

Filtering
=============
.. autofunction:: trackintel.preprocessing.filter.spatial_filter


Positionfixes
=============

As positionfixes are usually the data we receive from a tracking application of some sort,
there are various functions that extract meaningful information from it (and in the process
turn it into a higher-level *trackintel* data structure).

In particular, we can generate staypoints and triplegs from positionfixes.

.. autofunction:: trackintel.preprocessing.positionfixes.generate_staypoints

.. autofunction:: trackintel.preprocessing.positionfixes.generate_triplegs

Staypoints
==========

Staypoints are points where someone stayed for a longer period of time (e.g., during a
transfer between two transport modes). We can cluster these into locations that a user 
frequently visits and/or infer if they correspond to activities.

.. autofunction:: trackintel.preprocessing.staypoints.generate_locations

Due to tracking artifacts, it can occur that one activity is split into several staypoints. 
We can aggregate the staypoints horizontally that are close in time and at the same location.

.. autofunction:: trackintel.preprocessing.staypoints.merge_staypoints

Triplegs
========

Triplegs denote routes taken between two consecutive staypoint. Usually, these are traveled
with a single mode of transport.

From staypoints and triplegs, we can generate trips that summarize all movement and 
all non-essential actions (e.g., waiting) between two relevant activity staypoints.

.. autofunction:: trackintel.preprocessing.triplegs.generate_trips

The function `generate_trips` follows this algorithm:

.. image:: /_static/tripalgorithm.png
   :scale: 100 %
   :align: center

Trips
========

Trips denote the sequence of all triplegs between two consecutive activities. These can be composed of multiple means
of transports. A further aggregation of Trips are Tours, which is a sequence of trips such that it starts and ends
at the same location. Using the trips, we can generate tours.

.. autofunction:: trackintel.preprocessing.trips.generate_tours

Trips and Tours have an n:n relationship: One tour consists of multiple trips, but due to nested or overlapping tours,
one trip can also be part of mulitple tours. A helper function can be used to get the trips grouped by tour.

.. autofunction:: trackintel.preprocessing.trips.get_trips_grouped
