*trackintel* is a library for the analysis of spatio-temporal tracking data with a focus on human mobility. The core of *trackintel* is the hierachical data model for movement data that is used in GIS, transport planning and related fields [[1]](#1). We provide functionalities for the full life-cycle of human mobility data analysis: import and export of tracking data of different types (e.g, trackpoints, check-ins, trajectories), preprocessing, data quality assessment, semantic enrichment, quantitative analysis and mining tasks, and visualization of data and results.
Trackintel is based on [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/#)

You can find the documentation on the [trackintel documentation page](https://trackintel.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

Try *trackintel* online in a MyBinder notebook: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mie-lab/trackintel/HEAD?filepath=%2Fexamples%2Ftrackintel_basic_tutorial.ipynb)

## Data model

An overview of the data model of *trackintel*:
* **positionfixes** (Raw tracking points, e.g., GPS recordings or check-ins)
* **staypoints** (Locations where a user spent time without moving, e.g., aggregations of positionfixes or check-ins). Staypoints can be classified into the following categories:
  * **activity** staypoints. Staypoints with a purpose and a semantic label, e.g., stopping at a cafe to meet with friends or staying at the workplace.
  * non-activity staypoints. Staypoints without an explicit purpose, e.g., waiting for a bus or stopping in a traffic jam.
* **locations** (Important places that are visited more than once, e.g., home or work location)
* **triplegs** (or stages) (Continuous movement without changing mode, vehicle or stopping for too long, e.g., a taxi trip between pick-up and drop-off)
* **trips** (The sequence of all triplegs between two consecutive activity staypoints)
* **tours** (A collection of sequential trips that return to the same location)

An example plot showing the hierarchy of the *trackintel* data model can be found below:

The image below explicitly shows the definition of **locations** as clustered **staypoints**, generated by one or several users.

You can enter the *trackintel* framework if your data corresponds to any of the above mentioned movement data representation. Here are some of the functionalities that we provide: 

* **Import**: Import from the following data formats is supported: `geopandas dataframes` (recommended), `csv files` in a specified format, `postGIS` databases. We also provide specific dataset readers for popular public datasets (e.g, geolife).
* **Aggregation**: We provide functionalities to aggregate into the next level of our data model. E.g., positionfixes->staypoints; positionfixes->triplegs; staypoints->locations; staypoints+triplegs->trips; trips->tours
* **Enrichment**: Activity semantics for staypoints; Mode of transport semantics for triplegs; High level semantics for locations

## How it works
*trackintel* provides support for the full life-cycle of human mobility data analysis.

**[1.]** Import data. 
```python
import geopandas as gpd
import trackintel as ti

# read pfs from csv file
pfs = ti.io.file.read_positionfixes_csv(".\examples\data\pfs.csv", sep=";", index_col="id")
# or with predefined dataset readers (here geolife) 
pfs, _ = ti.io.dataset_reader.read_geolife(".\tests\data\geolife_long")
```

**[2.]** Data model generation. 
```python
# generate staypoints and triplegs
pfs, sp = pfs.as_positionfixes.generate_staypoints(method='sliding')
pfs, tpls = pfs.as_positionfixes.generate_triplegs(sp, method='between_staypoints')
```

**[3.]** Visualization.
 ```python
# plot the generated tripleg result
tpls.as_triplegs.plot(positionfixes=pfs, staypoints=sp, staypoints_radius=10)
```

**[4.]** Analysis.
 ```python
# e.g., predict travel mode labels based on travel speed
tpls = tpls.as_triplegs.predict_transport_mode()
# or calculate the temporal tracking coverage of users
tracking_coverage = ti.temporal_tracking_quality(tpls, granularity='all')
```

**[5.]** Save results.
 ```python
# save the generated results as csv file 
sp.as_staypoints.to_csv('.\examples\data\sp.csv')
tpls.as_triplegs.to_csv('.\examples\data\tpls.csv')
```

For example, the plot below shows the generated staypoints and triplegs from the imported raw positionfix data.

## Installation and Usage
*trackintel* is on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/trackintel/), you can install it in a `GeoPandas` available environment using: 
```{python}
pip install trackintel
```

You should then be able to run the examples in the `examples` folder or import trackintel using:
```{python}
import trackintel as ti

ti.print_version() 
```
